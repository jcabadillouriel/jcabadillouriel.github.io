Abstract of the talk: Hole spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots afford the advantage of efficient electrical control. This control is enabled by the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the  valence band of semiconductors, which couples the spin to the real-space motion of the hole in the applied electric fields. In this talk, I will present our recent theoretical and experimental progress on hole spin qubits. We show that the intrinsic SOI of the semiconductor valence band offers unique mechanisms to manipulate the hole spins. While this electrical susceptibility couples the hole spin to charge noise, I will show that hole qubits can be engineered to minimize decoherence at sweet spots. Finally, I will cover how the SOI allows the coupling of the hole spin to cavity photons, going well beyond what has been achieved with electron spins and paving the way toward a long-range photon-mediated two-qubit gate.
