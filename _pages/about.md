I am a Comfuturo fellow working at ICMM-CSIC in the <a href="https://wp.icmm.csic.es/tqe/">Theory of Quantum Materials and Solid State Quantum Technologies</a> group on semiconductor-based quantum computation and hybrid quantum devices. Not too long ago I used to be a postdoctoral researcher at the CEA-Grenoble in the <a href='https://www.mem-lab.fr/L_SIM'>L-Sim group</a>, where I worked from 2020 to 2023. Prior to this, I was also a postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the <a href='https://pages.physics.wisc.edu/~friesen/group.html'>Silicon Qubit Theory Group</a> from 2018 to 2020.

My research focuses on quantum computation in condensed matter systems. In particular, I enjoy developing theory for the quantum phenomena that naturally arises in realistic devices, connecting directly with experimental results. I perform analytical and numerical calculations of such phenomena to optimize quantum operations.
