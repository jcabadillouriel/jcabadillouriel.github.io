We have now published our paper <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.235426">Hole spin manipulation in inhomogeneous and non-separable electric fields</a>!!

***

Recent experiments with hole spins in symmetric Ge dots show spin manipulation when operating with in-plane magnetic fields; see, for instance <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17211-7">[1]</a>. However, conventional g-TMR or Rashba interactions in Ge disk-shaped holes do not allow efficient manipulation in such circumstances. In our work, we go beyond the usual assumptions of separable confinement potentials and homogeneous driving fields, as is the case in the experiments, and find new mechanisms emerging that affect the manipulability of hole spins. In particular, we find that such mechanisms allow manipulation with in-plane magnetic fields; hence, they are part of the relevant mechanisms behind the observed manipulability in the experiments.
