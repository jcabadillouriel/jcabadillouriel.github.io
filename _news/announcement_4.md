Good news everyone! Our paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-023-01332-3">Strong coupling between a photon and a hole spin in silicon</a> just got published!!

***

Cavity photons are very interesting mediators of interactions between distant qubits. This technology is very versatile, allowing to couple qubits of different types or even platforms. Up to now, spin-photon coupling in hybrid quantum dot-cQED devices had been achieved with electrons and the help of micromagnets. In this work, we show experimentally for the first time that holes provide a natural way for coupling spins with light due to the large spin-orbit coupling in the valence band. The results are striking since the achieved spin-photon coupling is one order of magnitude larger than the largest value achieved with electrons so far. The difference, however, is that we did not need any micromagnets to achieve this value, simplifying the device layout. Furthermore, the large value of the coupling invites us to think that this can be an interesting system to study light-matter interactions.
