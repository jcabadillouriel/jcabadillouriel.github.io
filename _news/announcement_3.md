Good news everyone! Our paper <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.L041303">Tunable hole spin-photon interaction based on g-matrix modulation</a> just got published!!

***

One possible way of scaling up spin qubits is through the cavity photons of a superconducting resonator. In these hybrid setups, the photon can be used as a mediator of the interaction between distant semiconductor qubits. In this work, we show that hole spins in minimal setups (single quantum dots) can be readily coupled to cavity photons thanks to their intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We identify the g-matrix modulation mechanism and evaluate in detail its potential use for longitudinal readout and two qubit gates. Due to the properties of the hole, we uncover a geometrical property, reciprocal sweetness, which allows to couple the hole spin either transversely or longitudinally to the photons while preserving good coherence properties.
